i do not believe in the coincidental nature
in the relationship between fault lines under the earth's surface
and the faults we see in one another
energy release creates cracks in the foundation
exposing all the layers of trust and intimacy
every so often the tectonic plates release so much built up stress
it shakes the ground we walk on
bringing everything down to its knees
turning it into an unrecognizable ground zero
you wander around, looking at the war zone
where mother nature declared victory
and you dust off your shoes, roll up your sleeves
and build again.
